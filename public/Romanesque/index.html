<h1>Romanesque</h1>
<h2>Unreal Engine 5</h2>
<h2>2024-10</h2>
<img src="/images/Romanesque_4K.png" alt="">

<p>Romanesque is my first deep dive into game technology and a full stack of software required to make highly detailed 3D sculptures, for a virtual environment. This is my first seriously detailed project and took a lot of time and effort.
  I wanted this to be proof that I can do anything and truly impress myself with my own art, and I think I have done that. In this post I will go over the tools and techniques I used, I'll show some in progess versions and at the end I'll go over how I can use
  these technologies both in Unreal Engine and Unity. This project was done following a tutorial by <a href="https://flippednormals.com/creator/fasttracktutorials?tagIds=1">FastTrack Tutorials</a>.

<h3>Modeling</h3>
<p>This project starts in Blender, using reference images. The first thing I've learnt here is that the easiest way for me to make a new model from scratch is to start with bezier curves. In the 2D side view, using the curves to make the profile of an object firstly,
  allowing for smooth edges and corner with ease. This makes the process really simple, then I can extrude the profile into the 3rd dimension. If its a cuboid, then shearing the profile into a corner is a helpful trick for making a corner while conserving all of the 
  details in the profile. If its cylindrical, then a screw modifier helps out heaps. Models come out looking great!

<h3>Blockout</h3>
<p>The next step of the process is to create the grey blockout of the environment in the engine, testing the models fit together and that the modular models are working.</p>

<h3>Sculpting / Normal Map</h3>
<p>With everything in place I move on to Zbrush to sculpt higher details onto the models that will be sitting in the foreground! The workflow in Zbrush is really simple, I dynamesh the model into a high poly mesh with a few million faces, and using only 2 brush,
  trimdynamic and smoothboord, I sculpt damages and finer details. Then using decimation master, create a second low poly version of the model for baking normal maps in Marmoset Toolbag.

<h3>Marmoset is Awesome</h3>
<p>Side by side, low poly model, with and without normal map of the Zbrush details. Thank you Marmoset</p>

<h3>Mask Map</h3>
<p>Substance Painter has tools for generative details on models. Baking them and creating my own tempalte smart material and export profile, allows me to generate unique mask maps per model that give more details like dirt, colour variation, dust, roughness variatiom etc.
  This really gives the model signs of life and the best part being that these details can be exposed in the material editors of both Unreal Engine and Unity. So that I can create further unique variations of each generative detail.
