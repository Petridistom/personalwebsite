         <a href="https://gosfordregionalgallery.com/page/john-power-wander-and-dwell#">Wander and Dwell</a> is a commissioned artwork for the Gosford Gallery in New South Whales, led by artist John Power, that takes the natural landscape of Gosford and replicates it inside Unity for spirits to wander. 
         My role in this project is as research assistant, where I am researching and developing ways to implement features. My focus was on a statemachine for biped creation spirits, retargeting human animations from asset stores, and a procedural animation override for sticking feet to uneven terrain.
         As well as bipeds I'm implementing the same procedural movement for a 6 legged leviathan creature to be inhabiting the terrain as well.<br>
        My workflow consists of parsing through asset stores, online user manuals and documentation to find software packages or systems that can achieve my desired effect. Then making tutorial videos or documentation for John Power to be able to implement
        the features into the main project.

      <span>Using Unity's animation statemachine and retargeted animations from online, I am able to create a logical animation tree that allows bipeds to walk, stop, sit and stand in natural order. 
        Using the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/legs-animator-154245">LegsAnimator</a> Unity asset to override the feet and hips so that they align with the surface and give a natural posture.

      <span>Using Blender I created a 6 legged testing rig for the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/legs-animator-154245">LegsAnimator</a> asset to fully animate the legs like a spider, allowing them to lift, move and land in my desired speed, location and frequency.
      This required some slight tweaking of the code in order to allow for unlimited input values for speed and step duration.</span>

      <span>Fully 3D modeled base mesh for creation spirits Yee and Byamee who are the bipeds wandering the lands. Based on hand drawn sketches which are based on the Indigenous Australian creation spirit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiame">Baiame</a>.
        I 3D modeled and rigged these in blender for animation retargeting in Unity.</span>

      <span>In order to have the creation spirits walking around I downloaded several physical root animations from online and used 3dsMax's <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/3DSMAX/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-EA1D6D09-A2CD-4204-8093-A7AE5EC5E333">CAT system</a>
      to retarget them onto my rigs. Then using <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/umotion-pro-animation-editor-95991">UmotionPro</a> to tweak the posture of the characters. Enjoy this video I made for John to show him how to use CAT.</span>
