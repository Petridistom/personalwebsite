         Wander & Dwell is a commissioned artwork for the Gosford Gallery in New South Whales, led by artist John Power, that takes the natural landscape of Gosford and replicates it inside Unity for spirits to wander. 
         My role in this project is as research assistant, where I am researching and developing ways to implement features. My focus was on a statemachine for biped creation spirits, retargeting human animations from asset stores, and a procedural animation override for sticking feet to uneven terrain.
         As well as bipeds I'm implementing the same procedural movement for a 6 legged leviathan creature to be inhabiting the terrain as well.<br>
        <div class="smallbreak"></div>
        My workflow consits of parsing through asset stores, online user manuals and documentation to find software packages or systems that can achieve my desired effect. Then making tutorial videos or documentation for John Power to be able to implement
        the features into the main project.
