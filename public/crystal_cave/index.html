        My goal with Crystal Cave was to create a whole environment myself from concept art, starting from experimenting with 3D texture shaders.
        My aim was to make everything in the scene from models to lighting to texturing as best quality as I possibly can while maintaining optimization for real-time rendering and effects.
        The main models in the scene I created in Blender and painted them in Substance 3D Painter for physically based textures and ambient occlusion. Others were textured inside Unreal Engine to take advantage of parallax occlusion mapping and simulation time. The large hills, background scenery and snow are megascans from the Quixel library on Fab.
        Shaders, VFX, animation and rendering are all done inside Unreal Engine 5.
