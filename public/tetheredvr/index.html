          People do not have a god like control over their emotions and thoughts, these things are constantly being generated by our environment. A person experiencing 
          an anxiety attack will lose control of their senses and become overwhelmed by negative thoughts and signals from their environment, causing them to experience 
          physical and mental symptoms. An accelerated heart rate, sweating, crying, chest pain and mental distress such as extreme feelings of shame, embarrassment, 
          self-hate, feelings of impending doom and incredibly low self-worth are all things that attack you during an extreme anxiety episode.<br>
          <div class="smallbreak"></div>
          Immersive virtual environments can be designed to help a person recover from an anxiety attack or from feelings of anxiety from their day-to-day life. 
          Making use of biophilic principles for attention restoration and immersive design, thoughtful 3D virtual experiences can be created offering 
          a unique approach to anxiety recovery.
