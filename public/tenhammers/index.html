          <a href="https://tenhammers.com/">Ten Hammers</a> is a virtual reality training company that creates training modules for air cabin crew. Part of their upcoming 
          services is a door training module, an escape slide operation module and a towbar module, aimed at teaching cabin crew how to operate these equipment. These are 
          original 3D models created based on training material and reference videos for safe operation of the equipment. They are 1:1 digital twins of their real life counterparts.<br>
          At Ten Hammers I was the sole developer for 3D models for their upcoming services, check their website to see my models in use.
