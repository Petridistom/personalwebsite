          During my second and third years at RMIT design my friend Adrian and I created and hosted
          a community of practice for our peers. We were in the early stages with 3D tech and we wanted to 
          create a space for others like ourselves who were teaching themselves 3D software. I had recognised 
          how difficult it is to learn something online by yourself and so I wanted a place for all
          of us doing so to connect and share our collective efforts for learning.<br>
          <div class="smallbreak"></div>
           This way when someone would learn
          some helpful life saving technique, we could immediately share it, with all our peers. And so we created Friday Blender.
          Every week we would meet in the student space on campus and Adrian and I would share our findings for the week and encourage 
          other students to share their knowledge as well. Our community grew and we were seeing around 10-12 students coming to visit us each week!
          After a semester, we began incorporating our own mini tutorials. During the week Adrian or I would prepare a short demo on something helpful
          in a modelling or texturing software and then give a live demo to our visitors to show them powerful workflows. They loved it!
