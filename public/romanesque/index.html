         Romanesque is a proof to myself, up until now I have always felt like my modeling skills and my concept rendering ideas have been subpar. I started this project 
         because I wanted to achieve my goal to be able to truly create anything in 3D. Romanesque is a 3D environment made in Unreal Engine that has taught me a powerful workflow
         for creating models using an entire package of software rather than just Blender and has allowed me to acheive the next level of detail and story telling in my 3D art.<br>
        <div class="smallbreak"></div>
         For the first time in my self taught 3D journey I decided to spend money on a project. The concept for this is from <a href="https://flippednormals.com/creator/fasttracktutorials">FastTrackTutorials</a>
        on FlippedNormals. It has been over 18 months since I started teaching myself 3D art and I felt that it was time for monetary investment. So I bought their tutorial and spent a month 
        creating this project. I created all the models myself and followed along the videos for the texturing process. This has given me a new workflow + template that I will be using again for future art.
