        The Elevator is a short virtual experience about the irrational fear of elevators & claustrophobia. Based on my personal experience in a hotel as a child in Crete, the experience
        takess you through the thoughts and fears that I felt. The means of interaction are limited and gameplay is distinctly lacking, these are key features of the environment as the are
        representative of the real experiences that claustrophobia creates.<br>
        As my first virtual environment, The Elevator relies mostly on sound design and simple animation to present my ideas. The sound design is most important as it elevates the game from 
        a simple environment to a more personal experience and the animation physically projects the feeling of suffocation from a tight space that inspires this project. The Elevator is my 
        experiential way of presenting the fears and imaginations that manifest from claustrophobia.
