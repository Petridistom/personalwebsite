          Earth Ward is restorative environment for the Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital. A holistic approach to clinical care spaces, that would enhance 
          the healing process for young patients, parents and staff. My role in this group project was to create a 3D visualisation of Earth Ward 
          to show in our presentation pitch.<br>

          A unique aspect of this design was the use of digital media as a form of biophilia. Since the hospital cannot include actual living plants due to 
          allergens and irritants, the Earth Ward needed to use digital media to introduce elements of biophilia into the space. Digital displays connect visitors to nature, 
          providing the healing benefits of biophilia.
